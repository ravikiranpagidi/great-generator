# Determinism and Reproducibility

Great Generator is designed to make synthetic data generation repeatable when users provide the same inputs.

## What is deterministic

For the same library version, schema, row counts, seed, realism mode, generation plan, and arguments, generation should produce the same logical output.

This applies to:

- single-table `generate_from_schema(...)` calls
- relational `generate_relational(...)` calls
- parsed DDL contracts passed into `generate_from_schema(...)`
- domain generation with fixed `scale` or fixed `rows`
- CDC generation when event counts and rates are fixed
- deterministic business-rule examples, such as the retail star-schema demo

## When to pass a seed

`seed` is optional.

Use it when you need reproducible test fixtures, CI checks, tutorials, demos, research experiments, or benchmark comparisons.

```python
from great_generator import generate_from_schema

schema = "customer_id int, customer_name string, email string"

first = generate_from_schema(schema, rows=100, seed=42)
second = generate_from_schema(schema, rows=100, seed=42)

assert first.equals(second)
```

If you do not pass a seed, Great Generator can still create useful synthetic data, but exact values may vary between runs.

## What can change output

Output can change when you change:

- package version
- schema or DDL
- row counts
- seed
- realism mode
- custom rules
- advisor plan
- domain pack behavior
- optional anomaly settings
- engine-specific execution path

For long-lived experiments, record these inputs in a manifest.

## Spark note

Spark DataFrames are distributed. Row content can be deterministic, but physical file layout, partition order, and row order after distributed operations may vary unless users explicitly sort or repartition.

For deterministic Spark comparisons:

```python
actual = df.orderBy("id").toPandas()
```

or compare by primary keys and columns instead of relying on physical file order.

## Recommended reproducibility checklist

- Pin the package version.
- Save the schema or DDL contract.
- Save row counts and generation arguments.
- Pass an explicit seed.
- Record the engine and runtime.
- Save a generation manifest.
- Validate keys and expected business rules after generation.
