# Advisor layer

The advisor layer helps at design time. It can infer a generation plan, tag schema columns, and review a generated sample. It does not generate row data.

The default advisor is `advisor="none"`. In that mode Great Generator makes no model calls, reads no API keys, and sends nothing over the network.

## What advisors do

Advisors can produce:

- `GenerationPlan`, an editable JSON plan for how columns should be generated
- `ColumnTags`, editable JSON tags for PII class, business semantic, and suggested masking
- `RealismReport`, a design-time review of a generated sample against a plan

Advisors do not:

- create per-row values
- repair generation errors
- infer relationships between tables
- accept natural language as a schema entry point
- run generated code

## Determinism guarantee

Generation is deterministic. Advisors run before generation and produce artifacts. Generation consumes those artifacts.

```text
schema -> advisor -> plan -> generation -> data
```

Given the same schema, plan, seed, and generation arguments, output should be the same. If you edit a plan, save it as JSON and treat it as part of your test fixture.

## Choosing an advisor

| Advisor spec | Status | Network | Requirements | Use when |
|---|---|---:|---|---|
| `none` | Default | No | Base package | You want no model calls and dtype-based defaults |
| `anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6` | Supported | Yes | `great-generator[anthropic]`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | You want an online model to suggest plans and tags |
| `ollama:llama3.1:8b` | Supported | Local only | Ollama running on the machine | You want offline or private local review |
| `openai:gpt-4o-mini` | Stub | Not used | Not implemented in v1 | Planned path |
| `llamacpp:/path/to/model.gguf` | Stub | Not used | Not implemented in v1 | Planned path |

## Offline usage with Ollama

Install Ollama, start the local service, and pull a model:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://ollama.com/install.sh | sh
ollama serve
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

On macOS or Windows, install Ollama from [ollama.com/download](https://ollama.com/download), then run:

```bash
ollama pull llama3.1:8b
```

Use the local advisor:

```python
from great_generator import infer_generation_plan

plan = infer_generation_plan(
    "customer_id int, customer_name string, email string",
    advisor="ollama:llama3.1:8b",
)
```

By default the Ollama advisor calls `http://localhost:11434`. Set `OLLAMA_HOST` if your local server uses a different address.

## Anthropic usage

Install the extra and set an API key:

```bash
pip install "great-generator[anthropic]"
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="..."
```

Then call:

```python
from great_generator import infer_generation_plan

plan = infer_generation_plan(
    "customer_id int, customer_name string, email string",
    advisor="anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6",
)
```

## Caching

Advisor calls are cached under `.gg_cache/` by default.

Each cache entry is keyed by:

```text
advisor_name + model_id + prompt_version + canonical_input_json
```

The cache layout is:

```text
.gg_cache/
  anthropic/
    ab/
      abc123...json
  ollama/
    cd/
      cde456...json
```

Each entry stores:

- cache key
- advisor
- model id
- prompt version
- input hash
- response
- created timestamp

Use `refresh_cache=True` to bypass the cache for one call:

```python
plan = infer_generation_plan(
    schema,
    advisor="ollama:llama3.1:8b",
    refresh_cache=True,
)
```

You can also delete `.gg_cache/` manually.

## Editing plans by hand

Plans are JSON. You can save, inspect, edit, and commit them.

```python
from great_generator import infer_generation_plan

plan = infer_generation_plan("customer_id int, customer_name string")
plan.to_json("plans/customer_plan.json")
```

Example snippet:

```json
{
  "human_reviewed": false,
  "columns": [
    {
      "column": "customer_name",
      "dtype": "string",
      "strategy": "semantic.full_name",
      "parameters": {},
      "rationale": "Name-like field.",
      "confidence": 0.92,
      "source": "advisor"
    }
  ]
}
```

Programmatic edits mark the plan as reviewed:

```python
reviewed = plan.with_edit(
    "customer_name",
    strategy="semantic.full_name",
    confidence=1.0,
    rationale="Reviewed by data team.",
)
```

`with_edit(...)` returns a new plan, sets the edited column `source` to `user_edit`, and sets `human_reviewed=True`.

## Manifest enrichment

When a plan is used, a manifest can include advisor metadata:

```json
{
  "advisor": {
    "name": "anthropic:claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "model_id": "claude-sonnet-4-6",
    "plan_version": "1.0",
    "plan_fingerprint": "sha256:...",
    "called_at": ["schema_understanding", "column_tagging"],
    "cache_hit": true,
    "columns_tagged": 23,
    "human_reviewed": false
  }
}
```

This is additive metadata. Existing manifest fields are not renamed or removed.

## Prompt safety

Any schema text, column description, hint, or sample value sent to an advisor is treated as untrusted input. Prompt files place user-supplied content inside a `<user_input>...</user_input>` block. Advisor output is parsed as JSON and never executed as code. The library does not use `eval`, shell interpolation, or dynamic imports based on advisor output.
